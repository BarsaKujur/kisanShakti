Problem Statement: “The Crisis Beneath the Soil”

In India, over 60% of farmers rely on traditional knowledge passed down through generations—but today’s climate shifts, soil degradation, and market volatility have outpaced those traditions. The result? Uninformed crop choices, pest outbreaks, missed subsidies, and devastating financial losses.

Imagine a smallholder farmer in Odisha. He plants sugarcane, unaware that his region’s declining rainfall and acidic soil are unsuitable. Mid-season, pests attack—but he doesn’t know what they are, let alone how to treat them. He buys the wrong fertilizer, misses a government subsidy he qualifies for, and sells his produce at a local mandi for half the price it could fetch elsewhere. Not because he’s careless—but because the system failed him.

This isn’t an isolated case—it’s the daily reality for millions.
